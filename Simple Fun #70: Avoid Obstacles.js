Description

Task
You are given an array of integers arr that representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.
Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the 
same length represented by some integer.
Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

Example
For arr = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be 4.
Check out the image below for better understanding:

Input/Output
[input] integer array arr
Non-empty array of positive integers.
Constraints: 1 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 100.
[output] an integer
The desired length.

function avoidObstacles(arr) {
  for (let n = 1; ; n++) {
    if (arr.every((x) => x % n != 0)) {
      return n;
    }
  }
}
